    # Theoretically, another way of creating row_string would be to use the *join* method. We remember that *join* is
    # the opposite of the *split* method, and it expects a sequence of strings as argument.
    # But this would not work for our current example:
    # row_string = ",".join(olympians[0])

    # Another way to create row_string would be string concatenation, but this is the least preferred approach, as it
    # is cumbersome and hard to read.

# As described previously, if one or more columns contain text, and that text could contain commas, we need to do
# something to distinguish a comma in the text from a comma that is separating different values (cells in the table).
# If we want to enclose each value in double quotes, it can start to get a little tricky, because we will need to have
# the double quote character inside the string output. But it is doable. Indeed, one reason Python allows strings to be
# delimited with either single quotes or double quotes is so that one can be used to delimit the string and the other
# can be a character in the string. If you get to the point where you need to quote all of the values, we recommend
# learning to use pythonâ€™s csv module.
