# Coursera-Python-3-Programming

This repository contains the exercises, assignments and experiments I did as part of completing the Python 3 Programming Specialization on Coursera. ( https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python-3-programming )
The parent folders represent the first 4 out of 5 courses:
* Python Basics
* Python Functions, Files, and Dictionaries
* Data Collection and Processing with Python
* Python Classes and Inheritance

The fifth and final course consists of the capstone project and I created a separate repository for it here:
