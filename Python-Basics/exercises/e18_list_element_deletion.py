# Using slices to delete list elements can be awkward and therefore error-prone.
# Python provides an alternative that is more readable.
# The del statement removes an element from a list by using its position.
a = ['one', 'two', 'three']
del a[1]
print(a)  # ['one', 'three']

alist = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
del alist[1:5]
print(alist)  # ['a', 'f']

# As you might expect, del handles negative indices and causes a runtime error if the index is out of range.
# In addition, you can use a slice as an index for del.
# As usual, slices select all the elements up to, but not including, the second index.
